# sql-scf-2018

Materials for SCF workshop on databases and SQL

## Preparation

### Required

- Install either the RSQLite R package or the sqlite3 Python package on your laptop.
- Download [these data files](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/share/paciorek/tutorial-databases-data.zip) onto your laptop.

Alternatively, if you have an SCF account you can plan to use one of the SCF Macs in Evans 342, the location of the workshop. I'll also bring temporary SCF accounts with me that anyone can use for the workshop.

### Optional

If you'd like to be able to replicate the demo I do of creating a PostgreSQL database, you'll need to install PostgreSQL on your computer. Probably the easiest way to enable this is to install Docker, which will allow you to start up a Linux virtual machine on your laptop. See the [Mac instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or the [Windows instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) for how to install Docker. We'll set up PostgreSQL within Docker during the workshop.
